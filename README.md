# infinite-auto-scroll (WIP)

Auto scroll elements infinitely.

It's a combination of a hook and a React component that let's you auto scroll elements infinitely in a container while having the option to manually interact with the elements as well.                                                                                                 |

## Development

To develop this package locally, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo to your local.
2. Run `pnpm install` to install the dependencies.
5. Run `pnpm dev` to start the development server.
6. Go to `localhost:5173` in your browser.

This will start a hot-reloading setup with a live example.
